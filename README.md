# Optimal Array Processing 📡

This repository is dedicated to the study, dissection, and practical implementation of concepts from **"Optimum Array Processing" (Part IV of Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory) by Harry L. Van Trees**. 

As a bridge between rigorous electromagnetic theory and modern digital signal processing, this space serves as a technical log for mastering spatial filtering, beamforming, and radar systems.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The core of this repository is a collection of notes and simulations that translate the complex mathematics of the Van Trees textbook into intuitive Python and MATLAB implementations. 

### 📚 Key Topics Explored
- **Spatial Filters & Antenna Arrays:** Analyzing the geometry of wave interference (constructive and destructive) and path differences.
- **Beamforming Algorithms:** Implementing steering vectors, complex gains, and null-steering to isolate signals from interference.
- **MIMO & Phased Array Radar:** Simulating high-resolution spatial sampling and beam patterns.
- **The Space-Time Field:** Understanding the overlap of signals and noise in a regional space-time context.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Leveraging `NumPy` for matrix operations and `Matplotlib` for visualizing spatial spectra and beampatterns.
- **MATLAB:** Utilizing Signal Processing and Phased Array System toolboxes for advanced modeling.
- **LaTeX:** Ensuring technical accuracy in documentation and mathematical derivations.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/Chapter_02_Spatial_Filters`: Notes and scripts on the fundamental array response and wavenumber analysis.
- `/Simulations`: Interactive Python notebooks for beamforming and interference rejection.
- `/Problems`: Step-by-step solutions to challenging problems from the Van Trees text.
